Challenge

My challenge to solve is the problem of a company that is without

sufficient capital to create and build its own industrial plant, and cannot

cope with the growing demand that they have had in the last two months.

The company is in a dilemma, as it has two potential investors; The first

investor offers the amount of capital necessary for the creation of the

plant, in return he asks to intervene in the process and make certain

changes in the final product since he thinks that the idea he has has

shown good results in previous years and to have the participation of 50%

in the company, the second investor offers the capital necessary for the

creation of the plant in exchange for do not make modifications to the

final product, since this is the one that is generating the exponential

growth of the company, for the moment it is only asked to focus on the

company's success product and as they recover the investment they can

be extended to the innovation of products and creation for a 20% *****

within the company.

As a manager of the company, I need to make the best decision for the

above mentioned one.

Selection

I decided to choose the visualization tool, visualization allows me to

understand and analyze the context, to be able to define the needs and

their possible solutions. This tool is useful for me to have a clearer vision

of the current state ** the company and what it ultimately requires;

through this tool I can deduce the personalities of the two investors, such

as ****** and *****; and based on this I can make the best decision.

Application

In the application of my ****** tool to the challenge that I have set

myself, the tool has been of a very wide utility, since when applying it to

my challenge very good results were obtained, since with this I could have

an analysis to the measure of the two investors. The first thing I did with

my visualization tool was to conduct a study to customers who required

the flagship product of the company, first I had to understand why the

demand had had such a strong growth in the last two months, by applying

the tool I could find the answers to this question; I could see that

customers needed this product as it was, without any modification

because the product worked wonders.

With this study of the clients interested in the product, I was able to

analyze and follow up on the proposals I had on the table from the two

investors.

I concluded that I needed the person who was interested in the first

instance to supply the product that was having great success. Which was

the second investor, since he was interested in first of all to give the size

of production that our customers demanded, and then worry about

improving it, but in small and concise steps.

I discarded the first investor, as he did not meet the requirements that the

company needed at that time. I realized that this investor was convinced

that by changing the product to the way he thought, the demand was

going to increase more; but in reality what the company needed was to be

able to cover the demand that the product was having, this investor

wanted to ***** everything we had, to the side of the road, but he did not

think for a moment that these modifications should have a low impact in

case things do not go as well as expected.

Thanks to the application of the tool I was able to identify the key points

of the company's needs and how each investor, according to their

proposals, could help me, based on this I made the best decision. I chose

to work with the second investor, we were able to supply the demand for

the product, then the investment ******* and we were able to inject it into

research for product innovation, and make some small changes, which

were being introduced to customers ********** and in small quantities.

When customers became more interested in the improved product, we

decided to increase production by improving the product.

Perspective

The information and the final ****** that I had when *********** what we

obtained by using the visualization tool, the first thing is that we must

always think first about the needs of customers, of the people interested

in the product; it is very useful to know what the problem is, what is the

cause of the problem and finally build an effective solution. Secondly,

based on what we have obtained, we can find a partner that fits our

needs, and be able to work as a team, unifying ideas and producing

possible solutions. Thanks to the knowledge gained from the design

course, I was able to create a strategic plan for the company's problems

and make it a successful plan.

Approach

What I would apply differently in the challenge would be the tool used, I

would like to use the learning launch; I would do it in the following way,

rejecting the proposals of the two investors and only creating the way that

the production process would be decreased to be able to supply the

required demand. It may or may not work out, but I would like to have

employed this strategy.
